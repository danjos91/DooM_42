![screenshot/screen_game_begin.png](screenshot/screen_game_begin.png)

This game is a mix of Doom and Duke Nukem 3D. We implemented some basics functional elements and added new functionality. It was funny.

# How to use

We used Make (Makefile, Mac Os) as a build automation tool.

    $> make -j32
    $> ./doom_nukem (standard pack)
    or
    $> ./doom_nukem [filename]

# Map editor
